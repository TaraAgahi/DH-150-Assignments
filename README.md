# Assignment02:Pilot Usability Testing
## Introduction
### The Purpose of UT: Through this Usability Testing, I hope to get insights into my user habits and understand our mutual pain points. The purpose of this testing is to assess how easy user interfaces are to use. It also offers different perspectives and methods to interact with a website that the designer of said website or research study may not be familiar with. Usability testing analyzes the extent to which users achieve the metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction, learnability, memorability, usefulness, utility, usability, and accessibility in a specific context of use. Overall, this type of testing looks at a product's usability. I specifically am testing the three heuristic components of Flexibility & Efficiency of Use, Recognition Rather than Recall, and Aesthetic and Minimal Design. I am going to have my user give feedback on the Menu section, the layout of the website, the about section of the website, whether or not there is a frequently asked questions section to gauge recognition rather than recall, and lastly have my participant try and find a specific bit of information using the search bar.
